## 🚀 Overview

**The Mustang Experience** is a "God-Tier" concept website designed to push the boundaries of web interaction and visual fidelity. This project serves as a **technical showcase** demonstrating advanced front-end engineering, creative direction, and high-performance animation techniques.

It is not just a website; it is an **immersive digital showroom**.

## 💎 Key Features

*   **🎥 Cinematic Hero Section**: Features a high-definition, auto-playing video background with scroll-based parallax effects for immediate immersion.
*   **⚡ "Ignition" Preloader**: A custom entrance sequence that sets the tone before the DOM even paints.
*   **📜 Luxury Smooth Scroll**: Integrated **Lenis** scrolling physics for a "heavy," premium feel typically found in award-winning sites.
*   **🏎️ High-Octane Interactions**:
    *   **Heritage Scroll**: Sticky-positioned history timeline.
    *   **Tech Grid**: Bento-style grid with hover-glow effects and glassmorphism.
    *   **Horizontal Lineup**: Smooth horizontal scroll translation for vehicle models.
*   **🎨 Custom Design System**: Built on a strict "Mustang Red" & "Pure Black" palette with custom metallic gradients and neon glow effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with the modern "Bleeding Edge" stack:

*   **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Server Components)
*   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v3.4 with custom config)
*   **Animation**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Complex orchestrations)

## 👨‍💻 Built For Showcase

**This project was created solely for the purpose of showcasing my development skills.**

It demonstrates proficiency in:
1.  **Performance Optimization**: Handling heavy media assets (video/images) without compromising TTI (Time to Interactive).
2.  **UX/UI Design**: translating a brand identity ("Aggressive American Muscle") into code.
3.  **Modern React Patterns**: Using Hooks (`useScroll`, `useTransform`, `useSpring`) effectively.
